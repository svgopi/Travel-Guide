# Travel-Guide
 
Hello!!!
Travel-Guide project is about pointing markers of main places,hospital,malls, etc. of states in Maps, which makes tourists easy to identify the places without any confusion. And when you click on any marker in maps you will get short description about the place.

To open maps click on the Explore button which will redirect to new HTML page where Google Maps with markers are located, here we used google maps api key to get access of google maps.

Here the project link :
